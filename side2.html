            <h1>Did you know that your blood can determine your lineage,<br>but only to disprove it? üßê<br><br></h1>
            How is that possible? Well, it means that while blood can‚Äôt confirm someone as a child's parent,<br>
            it can disprove parentage if the blood types are incompatible.<br><br><br>

         <div>
            We all know that blood types are O, A, B, and AB, and that everyone has a different blood type.<br>
            There's a universal donor (blood type O, which can donate to anyone)<br>
            and a universal recipient (blood type AB, which can receive from anyone).<br><br><br>

            So, Doctor, how did we come up with these names?<br>
            The idea is that there are certain proteins on the surface of red blood cells called antigens (Ag).<br>
            The types of Ag here are Antigen A and Antigen B. <b>Based on this:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Type A contains Antigen A</li>
                <li>Type B contains Antigen B</li>
                <li>Type AB contains both Antigen A and B</li>
                <li>Type O doesn't contain any antigens</li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div>
            Now, let‚Äôs see how you can disprove lineage...<br><br>

Disproving lineage with blood types relies on the blood types of the parents, because in certain cases,<br>
it is impossible for a child to have a specific blood type based on the parents' blood types.<br><br><br>

This is based on Mendelian inheritance. For instance, if one parent is type A and the other is type B,<br>
they can potentially have a child with any of the four blood types, as they are more accurately AO and BO.<br>
This means all blood types are possible because B can pair with O to make B, B can pair with A to make AB,<br>
A can pair with O to make A, and O can pair with O to make O. However, if both parents are AB,<br>
it is impossible for them to have a child with type O blood because one of them must pass on either A or B,<br>
so type O will not appear.<br><br><br>

This is how we can use blood types to disprove lineage.<br>
The reason we use this method initially is that it is much cheaper than DNA testing,<br>
which is quite expensive.<br><br><br>

Stay safe ‚ô•Ô∏è<br><br><br>
